Welcome to TeamUp! TeamUp is the easiest way to create your favorite rosters for your favorite teams. Simply gather information about the team (rank, color, and name) to create a team. Once you have the team set up to perfection, add your players to create a formidable squad!

First, clone this repo to your local machine. To get the app up and working, first change directories into the backend folder (command: "cd backend"). Once there, run "rake db:seed" to get some starter data to play around with. Finally, run "rails s" to start up the server, and start crafting your perfect teams!
