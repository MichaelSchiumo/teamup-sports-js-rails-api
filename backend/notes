3. In Players controller, can I use include in the index/show actions

7. Rails as an API lab
  - set up relationships
  - set up options hash
    -defined in controller
      -after fetch to index, we will receive all of the teams and all of the relationships


//use IDs for index.html divs


function generateForm() {
  let form =  document.createElement('form')
  let nameInput = document.createElement('input')
  nameInput.setAttribute('name', 'name')
  //   <input name='name' value=''/>
}

//put debugger in generateForm to check each attribute
//div would live in a container on index.html
//do individual forms in multiple divs
  //abstract so that each link that is clicked displays a div (the generic div)


// sample form
<form>
  <label></label>
  <input name='' value=''/>
  <input type='submit' value='Submit' />
</form>


for players, create 5 input tags


//html visibility (create event listener to toggle true and false of form)
//default would be false for click event, you want to change HTML visibility to whatever it is not



-Add options hash to controller actions







//after create team form, wrap data in its own data so that we can clear it out (set innerHtml to '')




//filter allteams by team_id






//for show purposes

-write function renderTeamShow
  -take team wrapper and clear it
    -write click event for each team name
     -when you click on a team name, fires team show page
      -pass in event with an ID to find a specific team
        -filter through array of all teams and return a specific object
          -call addTeam, pass team object in

-parent function
  -takes in JSON array, filters
    -


-click on team
  -clear div
    -create div
      -fill new div with players
